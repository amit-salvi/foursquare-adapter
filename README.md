Foursquare Adapter Service
=============================================
This is a microservice which work as a wrapper ove Foursquare Public API.
The service exposes a REST endpoint /places/{place}, which would give the recommendations
regarding the place that we want to search

#### Jasypt for encrypting the Foursquare API credentials
I have used Jasypt in order to encrypt cliend id and client secret that is required to run the REST call of Foursquare API

Sample command
```
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?near=NYC&client_id=<clientID>&client_secret=<clientSecret>&v=20190217
```

### Build
To build the JAR, execute the following command from the parent directory:

```
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage
```

#### Run the service
In order to run the service through CMD using java -jar command, please pass following properties through command line:

```
